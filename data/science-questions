      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The statement 'Energy can neither be created nor destroyed' is not one of Newton's laws of motion; it is the law of conservation of energy. Newton's three laws are: (1) An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force, (2) Force equals mass times acceleration, and (3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
